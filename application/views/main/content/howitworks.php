                            haven&#39;t experienced a birthday celebration. In marginalized communities, birthdays often go
                            unnoticed due to financial constraints. We organize birthday parties with cake, new clothes, and
                            chosen gifts, making each child feel seen, valued, and deserving of joy.</p> -->
