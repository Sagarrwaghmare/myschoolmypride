                    <div class="text-gray-400 space-y-2">
                        <p>At CFTI, we believe every child deserves to feel celebrated and cherished, especially on
                            their special day. In many
                            marginalized communities, birthdays often go unnoticed due to financial hardship or other
                            difficult circumstances.
                            Our initiative, Smiles4Birthday, aims to bring joy and a sense of self-worth to
                            underprivileged children by
                            celebrating their birthdays in a meaningful way.</p>
                        <p>Through this initiative, we organise small yet heartfelt birthday parties for children,
                            complete with cake, a set of new
                            clothes, and a gift of their choice. These celebrations go beyond the traditional festivity
                            of cakes and balloons; they
                            are moments of recognition, reflecting each child&#39;s uniqueness and reminding them that
                            they are seen, valued, and
                            deserving of happiness.</p>
                        <p>CFTI is dedicated to making a differenceâ€”instilling hope, empowerment, and joy in the lives
                            of those we serve.</p>
